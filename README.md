## Tech_plog


Tech_plog is a Node.js web application built using the Express.js framework, which enables it to handle HTTP requests and responses. The application also employs the Handlebars template engine to render dynamic views in HTML. Tech_plog uses a MySQL database and Sequelize ORM for object-relational mapping, which makes it easier to interact with the database.
